## Abstract
Peer-to-peer (P2P) markets allow small suppliers with limited capital to enter the markets that were traditionally occupied by large firms. This feature provides a potential decentralized distribution of opportunities. To investigate the distribution of welfare and opportunities among agents, I study the Airbnb short-term rental market, as a successful P2P marketplace. I use a daily panel-data of Airbnb rentals in Chicago between August 2014 to April 2017 and apply an individual-level multinomial logit model to estimate the distribution of consumer and producer surplus among differentiated agents and over time. I show that properties in less advantaged neighborhoods benefit the least from having access to the Airbnb market; even though these properties feature lower competitive pressure and lower opportunity cost of renting. My results show a disproportionate concentration of welfare in neighborhoods with higher income, house price, and in upper-class areas. However, I show evidences for higher surplus of low-income property owners specially for those who live in high-demand areas.
