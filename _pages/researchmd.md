#### Abstract:

Peer-to-peer (P2P) markets allow small suppliers with limited capital to enter the markets that were traditionally occupied by large firms. This feature provides a potential decentralized distribution of opportunities. To investigate the distribution of welfare and opportunities among agents, I study the Airbnb short-term rental market as a successful P2P marketplace. Airbnb market is highly dynamic, decentralized, and contains heterogeneous agents with limited capacities. These features present challenges for classic aggregated methods to estimate supply and demand for welfare analysis. I use a daily panel of Airbnb rentals in Chicago between August 2014 to April 2017, and apply an individual-level multinomial logit model to estimate the distribution of consumer and producer surplus among differentiated agents. I show that properties in less advantaged neighborhoods benefit the least from access to the Airbnb market; even though these properties feature lower competitive pressure and lower opportunity cost of renting. My results show a disproportionate concentration of welfare in neighborhoods with higher income, house price, and in upper-class areas.
