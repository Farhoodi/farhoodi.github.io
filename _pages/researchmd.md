## Working Papers

* **Welfare Distribution in Peer-to-Peer Markets with Heterogeneous Agents: The Case of Airbnb**

**Abstract:** Peer-to-peer (P2P) markets allow small suppliers with limited capital to enter markets that were traditionally occupied by large firms. This feature provides a potential decentralized distribution of opportunities. I investigate the distribution of welfare and opportunities among agents in the Airbnb short-term rental market. I use daily panel data of Airbnb rentals in Chicago from August 2014 through April 2017 and develop an individual-level multinomial logit model to estimate the distribution of consumer and producer surpluses across differentiated agents and over time. My results show a disproportionate concentration of welfare in neighborhoods with higher incomes and house prices. My counter-factual results suggests a better distributional effect of tax policy compared to restricting institutional hosts from operating in the market.
