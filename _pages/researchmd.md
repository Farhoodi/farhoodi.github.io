#### Abstract:

Peer-to-peer (P2P) markets allow small suppliers with limited capital to enter markets that were traditionally occupied by large firms. This feature provides a potential decentralized distribution of opportunities. To investigate the distribution of welfare and opportunities among agents, I study the Airbnb short-term rental market, as a successful P2P marketplace. I use daily panel data of Airbnb rentals in Chicago from August 2014 through April 2017 and apply an individual-level multinomial logit model to estimate the distribution of consumer and producer surpluses across differentiated agents and over time. I show that properties in less advantaged neighborhoods benefit the least from having access to the Airbnb market, even though these properties feature weaker competitive pressure and lower opportunity costs of renting. My results show a disproportionate concentration of welfare in neighborhoods with higher incomes and house prices. I also show evidence of a higher surplus for low-income property owners, especially for those who live in high-demand areas.
