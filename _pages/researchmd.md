####Abstract:

Peer-to-peer markets allow small suppliers with limited capitals to compete with traditional firms and provide more decentralized distribution of opportunities. I study distribution of welfare among agents in Airbnb short-term rentals as a successful P2P market. Airbnb market is highly dynamic, decentralized, and contains heterogeneous agents with limited capacities. These features present challenges for classic aggregated methods to estimate supply and demand for welfare analysis. I use micro-data for a panel of Airbnb rentals in Chicago between August 2014 to April 2017, and apply an individual-level multinomial logit model to estimate the distribution of consumer and producer surplus among differentiated agents. I show that properties in less advantaged neighborhoods benefit the least from access to the Airbnb market, even though these properties feature lower competitive pressure and lower opportunity cost of renting. My results show a disproportionate concentration of welfare in neighborhoods with higher income, house price, and upper-class areas.
