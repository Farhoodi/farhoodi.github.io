### Welfare Estimation in Peer-to-Peer Markets with Heterogeneous Agents: the Case of Airbnb
**Abstract:**
This paper studies welfare estimation in peer-to-peer markets with heterogeneous agents by using micro-data for Airbnb rentals in Chicago from August 2014 to April 2017. The highly dynamic, decentralized structure, along with great heterogeneity among agents in peer-to-peer markets present challenges for classic aggregated methods to estimate supply and demand for welfare analysis. To account for this heterogeneity, this paper first estimates a non-parametric hedonic model of listings' prices as a function of their time, location, and attributes; and then recovers consumer taste parameters by using a parametric assumption about utility functions and first-order maximization conditions (following Bajari and Benkard (2005)). The paper calculates agent-level producer surpluses through estimations of the causal relationship between prices and the probability that a given listing is booked. This relationship is estimated by applying instrumental generalized random forest (GRF). The findings show estimated average welfare gains of roughly \$1.50 for each dollar spent in Chicago, with gains higher in more expensive neighborhoods, and in more recent months of the data.
