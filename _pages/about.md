I am an applied microeconomist interested in Industrial Organizations, and applications of Big-Data and machine learning in economics. I am working on welfare estimation in peer-to-peer markets for my job market paper. I am also teaching a stand alone course on applied machine learning learning in economics at University of Illinois.
